## Project Description: Simple Text Editor using Tkinter

The provided Python script demonstrates the implementation of a simple text editor using the Tkinter library in Python. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities and features:

## GUI Interface
The text editor provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, a standard GUI toolkit for Python.

## Basic Text Editing Features
Users can perform typical text editing operations such as creating a new file, opening an existing file, saving the current file, and exiting the application.

## New File
Clicking on the "New" option under the "File" menu clears the content of the text editor, allowing users to start a new document.

## Open File
Clicking on the "Open" option under the "File" menu prompts the user to select a text file from their filesystem. The content of the selected file is then loaded into the text editor for viewing and editing.

## Save File
Clicking on the "Save" option under the "File" menu allows users to save the content of the current document to a file. If the document has not been previously saved, users are prompted to specify the filename and location.

## Text Area and Scrollbar
The text editor includes a text area where users can view and edit the content of their documents. Additionally, a vertical scrollbar is provided for navigating through the document, especially when it exceeds the visible area of the text editor.

## Graceful Exit
Users can exit the text editor by clicking on the "Exit" option under the "File" menu or by closing the application window.
